        <h3>How did you learn everything?</h3>
        <p>First let me say I don't know <i>everything</i>, but the stuff that I do know was mostly learned from the internet.  Khan Academy, Codecademy, and Udemy are all great resources that I would recommend.  I learned a lot about data structure from my APCS class back in high school, but that was Java, and I don't really use Java anymore.</p>

        <h3>How did you get into coding?</h3>
        <p>I got into coding through my friend Jeffrey.  In our Junior year of High Scool, Jeffrey was doing quite poor in his APCS class.  So what did Jeffrey do to raise his grade by 5%?  He referred me to the APCS class for my Senior year of high school.  Was I already going to sign up for APCS?  Probably because I had already done some "coding" with Lego Mindstorms before and liked it a lot, but this is too far back for me to remember.  The APCS class I was in taught Java, but it was mostly just about objects, classes, and algorithms.  There were no other applications for Java in this class.  Then I did all of these projects listed on my website that led up to where I am now!</p>
